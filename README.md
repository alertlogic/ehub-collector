# Alert Logic Event Collector for Microsoft Azure Event Hubs

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alertlogic/ehub-collector.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/alertlogic/ehub-collector)

# Overview

This repository contains the Microsoft Azure web application Node.js source code and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template required to set up a data collector in Azure to collect and forward events from Event Hubs to Alert Logic.

# Installation

To perform the setup required to grant Alert Logic permission to access Events Hub for event collection, you must have:

* A Microsoft Azure account with administrative privileges
* An Alert Logic user account with administrative privileges

## Security Permissions for the Collector application

A collector function application uses [Managed Service Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity) feature for assigning and managing permissions granted to the application.
By default, the event hub collector [template](templates/ehub.json) grants the following [roles/permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview#role-definition) to the application service principal:

   - [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role is granted to the entire resource group where a collector is deployed.
   - In case of data collection from an existing event hub, a [Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#reader) role is granted to the target resource group where existing event hub is located.


## Create an Alert Logic Access Key
<!--Not sure if AL capitalizes "Access Key," so I'm leaving it as-is until we have a style determination.-->

**From the Bash command line in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) run the following commands, where `<username>` is your Alert Logic user name and `<password>` is your Alert Logic password:**

```
export AL_USERNAME='<username>'
auth=$(curl -SX POST -u $AL_USERNAME https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/authenticate); export AL_ACCOUNT_ID=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.account.id'); export AL_USER_ID=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.user.id'); export AL_TOKEN=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.token'); if [ -z $AL_TOKEN ]; then echo "Authentication failure"; else roles=$(curl -SX GET -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/roles | jq -r '.roles[].name'); if [ "$roles" != "Administrator" ]; then echo "The $AL_USERNAME doesn’t have Administrator role. Assigned role is '$roles'"; else curl -SX POST -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys | jq .; fi; fi; unset AL_USERNAME;
```

**For accounts with multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled:**
```
export AL_USERNAME='<username>'
auth=$(curl -SX POST -d '{"mfa_code": "<mfa_code_here>" }' -u $AL_USERNAME https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/authenticate); export AL_ACCOUNT_ID=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.account.id'); export AL_USER_ID=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.user.id'); export AL_TOKEN=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.token'); if [ -z $AL_TOKEN ]; then echo "Authentication failure"; else roles=$(curl -SX GET -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/roles | jq -r '.roles[].name'); if [ "$roles" != "Administrator" ]; then echo "The $AL_USERNAME doesn’t have Administrator role. Assigned role is '$roles'"; else curl -SX POST -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys | jq .; fi; fi; unset AL_USERNAME;
```

An example of a successful response is:

```
{
  "access_key_id": "712c0b413eef41f6",
  "secret_key": "1234567890b3eea8880d292fb31aa96902242a076d3d0e320cc036eb51bf25ad"
}
```

**Note:** If the output is blank, verify the Alert Logic user account permissions. You must have administrator access. For more information about AIMS APIs, see [Access and Identity Management Service](https://console.product.dev.alertlogic.com/api/aims/).

Note the `access_key_id` and the `secret_key` values for use in the deployment steps below.

**Note:** An account can create only five access keys. If you receive a "limit exceeded" response, you must delete some access keys before you can create more. Use the following command to list access keys:

```
curl -s -X GET -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys | jq
```

In the following curl command, replace ``ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE`` with the access key you want to delete.

```
curl -X DELETE -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys/<ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE>
```

## Download and deploy the ARM template 

You can use either the Microsoft Azure portal or a command line to deploy the template. To perform either procedure, you must first log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

**Note:** The steps in this section require an active Azure subscription. To verify your Azure subscription, visit [Azure subscriptions blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade).

If your organization uses multiple Active Directory tenants, log into the correct tenant where a collector's Managed Service Identity needs to be registered.

The ARM template can be used to configure a new Azure Event Hub or have the Alert Logic collector reuse an existing one.

### Deploy with the custom ARM Template in an Azure Subscription

Click the button below to start deployment. 

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Falertlogic%2Fehub-collector%2Fv1%2Ftemplates%2Fehub.json)

1. To start a deployment, provide the following required template parameters, and then click the `Purchase` button:
   - **Application Name** - Type the name of the log source to appear in the Alert Logic console.
   - **Alert Logic Access Key ID** - Type the `access_key_id` you created above.
   - **Alert Logic Secret Key** - Type the `secret_key` you created above.
   - **Alert Logic API endpoint** - Leave the default value (api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com).
   - **Alert Logic Data Residency** - Leave the value as "default".

   **Note:** The following template parameters are optional and need to be entered only if reusing an existing Event Hub:

   - **Event Hub Resource Group** - Type the resource group for the existing Event Hub; leave empty if creating a new Event Hub.
   - **Event Hub Connection String** - Type the connection string for the existing Event Hub; leave empty if creating a new Event Hub.
   - **Event Hub Namespace** - Type the namespace for the existing Event Hub; leave empty if creating a new Event Hub.
   - **Event Hub Name** - Type the name of the existing Event Hub.

   **Note:** This value defaults to `insight-operational-logs`. This Event Hub is created automatically by Azure when a subscription [Log Profile is integrated with Event Hub through the Azure Monitor service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs#azure-subscription-monitoring-data).
   Follow this guide to [Stream the Azure Activity Log to Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/activity-logs-stream-event-hubs).

   - **Event Hub Consumer Group** - Type the name of the consumer group of the existing Event Hub.

   **Note:** This value defaults to `$Default`; you can reuse this consumer group if there are no other consumers of this Event Hub. If there are other consumers of the Event Hub, a separate consumer group should be created for the Alert Logic collector, and its name typed here.

1. Click **Purchase**.

**Note:** If you choose to create new event hub via the template then the following event hub scaling parameters are used:

   - 20 maximum throughput units,
   - auto-inflate is enabled,
   - 32 partitions count,
   - 7 day data retention period.
   
If you would like to use other parameters please change respective variable values in the the template or contact Alert Logic.

### Deploy through the Azure CLI

If you want to deploy the template through the Azure command line interface (CLI), you can use either [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart#start-cloud-shell) or a local installation of [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

**To deploy through the Azure CLI:**

1. In the command line, type the following to create a new resource group: 

   **Note:** The example below creates a new resource group in the "Central US" location.

   ```
   az group create --name <new-resource-group-name> --location "Central US"
   ```

1. In the Azure portal, access the `Resource groups` blade, and then select the resource group you created.
1. In the command line, type the following command to deploy a template, and enter the required parameters when prompted.
   
    ```
    az group deployment create \
        --resource-group <new-resource-group-name> \
        --template-uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alertlogic/ehub-collector/v1/templates/ehub.json"
    ```

## Verify the Installation
**To verify successful installation of the template:**

1. In the Azure portal, access `Function Apps`, and then choose the Alert Logic Event Hub collector function. 
1. Click `Functions` > `Master` > `Monitor` and verify the recent log entry has the status of `OK` and contains no error messages.
**Example:** `Ehub source checkin OK`.
1. In the Alert Logic console, navigate to `Configuration` > `Deployments` > `All Deployments` > `Log Sources`, and then filter the list by `Push (Office 365, EventHub)` collection method. 
1. Verify a new Azure Event Hub log source with the name provided during `az group deployment create` [above](#deploy-through-the-azure-cli) appears with the source status as `OK`.

# How the collector works

The [template](templates/ehub.json) creates an `AlertLogicIngest-<region-name>-<unique-string>` Event Hubs namespace where the "insights-operational-logs" event hub is created. The Alert Logic collector listens to the Azure event hub and forwards incoming events to the Alert Logic Ingestion service. If event collection fails, Alert Logic stores the data in the `alertlogic-dl` Azure Blob container located in the storage account you specified during template deployment. 

## Master function

The `Master` function is a timer trigger function responsible for:
- Registering the Azure web application in the Alert Logic backend
- Reporting health checks to the backend

**Note:** When you release a new version of the collector, remember to increment the version number in the npm package.json file.

## Updater function

The `Updater` function is a timer triggered function that runs a deployment sync operation every 12 hours to keep the web application up to date.

## EHubGeneral function

The `EHubGeneral` function listens to `insights-operational-logs`, which is created during [collector setup](#deploy-with-the-custom-arm-template-in-an-azure-subscription).
Collected JSON objects are wrapped into the protobuf [structure](https://github.com/alertlogic/al-collector-js/blob/master/proto/common_proto.piqi.proto) and then forwarded to the Alert Logic Ingestion service. If processing fails the data is stored in `alertlogic-dl` container for further processing.

## DLBlob function

If `EHubGeneral` cannot process incoming event hub records, unprocessed messages are saved as blobs to the `alertlogic-dl` container, so collection can be tried again later. The `alertlogic-dl` container is located in the collector web application storage account created during collector setup.
The `DLBlob` function processes dead letter blobs very 15 minutes. The `DLBlob` function lists all blobs located in  `alertlogic-dl` container and processes them according to the function to which the dead letter blob belongs. After a blob is processed, it is removed from the container.

# Local development

To enable local development, perform the following procedure:

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:alertlogic/ehub-collector.git`.
1. `cd ehub-collector`
1. Run `./local_dev/setup.sh`.
1. Edit `./local_dev/dev_config.js`.
1. Run the `Master` function locally: `npm run local-master`.
1. Run the `Updater` function locally: `npm run local-updater`.
1. Run the `EHubGeneral` function locally: `npm run local-ehub-general`.
1. Run `npm test` to perform code analysis and unit tests.

Please use the following [code style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as much as possible.
